A group of people just built their houses in a maze-like forest! 
Help them build a neighborhood by constructing the shortest path that connects all of their houses togther.

Instruction:

1. Press any number to initialize the number of houses (default is 2)
2. Left-click on any cell to assign a house to that cell. Right click to erase it.
3. When all houses are assigned, left-click again to create borders. If you are too lazy, button R is ready to serve!
4. When your maze is set up, press Space to run the path finding algorithm between each house (A star)
5. When all paths are found, press M to display the shortest path travelling across all houses (MST).
6. Wanna try again? Press C.

Notes:
1. Travelling diagonally costs 3/cell, otherwise 1.
2. Isolated houses will be colored red.
